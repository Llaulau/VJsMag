It was originally intended as a standardized method for controlling light dimmers, which, prior to DMX512, had employed various incompatible proprietary protocols. It soon became the primary method for linking controllers (such as a lighting console) to dimmers and special effects devices such as fog machines and intelligent lights. DMX has also expanded to uses in non-theatrical interior and architectural lighting, at scales ranging from strings of Christmas lights to electronic billboards. The use of DMX can now be used to control almost anything, reflecting its popularity in theatres and venues.";s:6:"parent";i:0;s:5:"count";i:2;s:9:"object_id";i:3600;s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}i:133;O:8:"stdClass":11:{s:7:"term_id";i:133;s:4:"name";s:8:"Ethernet";s:4:"slug";s:8:"ethernet";s:10:"term_group";i:0;s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";i:138;s:8:"taxonomy";s:8:"post_tag";s:11:"description";s:1010:"Ethernet is a family of computer networking technologies for local area networks (LANs). Ethernet was commercially introduced in 1980 and standardized in 1983 as IEEE 802.3. Ethernet has largely replaced competing wired LAN technologies such as token ring, FDDI, and ARCNET.

The Ethernet standards comprise several wiring and signaling variants of the OSI physical layer in use with Ethernet. The original 10BASE5 Ethernet used coaxial cable as a shared medium. Later the coaxial cables were replaced with twisted pair and fiber optic links in conjunction with hubs or switches. Data rates were periodically increased from the original 10 megabits per second to 100 gigabits per second.

Systems communicating over Ethernet divide a stream of data into shorter pieces called frames. Each frame contains source and destination addresses and error-checking data so that damaged data can be detected and re-transmitted. As per the OSI model Ethernet provides services up to and including the data link layer.";s:6:"parent";i:0;s:5:"count";i:1;s:9:"object_id";i:3600;s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}i:143;O:8:"stdClass":11:{s:7:"term_id";i:143;s:4:"name";s:3:"LED";s:4:"slug";s:3:"led";s:10:"term_group";i:0;s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";i:148;s:8:"taxonomy";s:8:"post_tag";s:11:"description";s:566:"A light-emitting diode (LED) is a two-lead semiconductor light source that resembles a basic pn-junction diode, except that an LED also emits light. When an LED's anode lead has a voltage that is more positive than its cathode lead by at least the LED's forward voltage drop, current flows. Electrons are able to recombine with holes within the device, releasing energy in the form of photons. This effect is called electroluminescence, and the color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photon) is determined by the energy band gap of the semiconductor.";s:6:"parent";i:0;s:5:"count";i:1;s:9:"object_id";i:3600;s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}i:628;O:8:"stdClass":11:{s:7:"term_id";i:628;s:4:"name";s:3:"XLR";s:4:"slug";s:3:"xlr";s:10:"term_group";i:0;s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";i:660;s:8:"taxonomy";s:8:"post_tag";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:6:"parent";i:0;s:5:"count";i:1;s:9:"object_id";i:3600;s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}}
