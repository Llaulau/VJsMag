<p style="color: #000000;">Since then, Eyebeam has supported some 245Â fellowships and residenciesÂ for artists and creative technologists; we've run an active education program forÂ youthÂ andÂ adults, artists' professional development and community outreach; and have mounted an extensive series ofÂ public programs. We produceÂ approximately 4 exhibitions and 40 workshops, performances, and events annually.</p>
Today, Eyebeam offers residencies and fellowships for artists and technologists working in a wide range of media. At any given time, there are up to 12Â resident artists and fellowsÂ onsite at Eyebeam's production spaces in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, developing newÂ projectsÂ and creating work for open dissemination through online, primarily open-source, publication as well as a robust calendar of public programming that includes free exhibitions, lectures and panels, participatory workshops, live performances and educational series.
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Mission</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Eyebeam is an art and technology center that provides a fertile context and state-of-the-art tools for digital research and experimentation. It is a lively incubator of creativity and thought, where artists and technologists actively engage with culture, addressing the issues and concerns of our time. Eyebeam challenges convention, celebrates the hack, educates the next generation, encourages collaboration, freely offers its contributions to the community, and invites the public to share in a spirit of openness: open source, open content and open distribution.</p>
