When an LED's anode lead has a voltage that is more positive than its cathode lead by at least the LED's forward voltage drop, current flows. Electrons are able to recombine with holes within the device, releasing energy in the form of photons. This effect is called electroluminescence, and the color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photon) is determined by the energy band gap of the semiconductor.";s:6:"parent";i:0;s:5:"count";i:1;s:9:"object_id";i:3600;s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
